# Coding Quiz Game Website
This project was created from the ground up without any seed files or templates. The bulk of the work was centered around using javascript to play a quiz game. HTML and CSS files were also created to mimic the example GIF of game play.

The game is a simple multiple choice quiz on web development questions. Questions are chosen at random and the choices are also randomized.

Answering the questions correctly adds time to the game clock. Once all the questions are finished or the time is out, the score is the time left on the clock. After the game is completed the user is prompted to add his/her initials to the high scores game ledger.

## Getting Started

Luckily this is a static site so there isn't much set-up to do. You should have a decent understanding of javascript if you want to understand how the game is played or enhance the user experience with an update. The deployed site is found at: [Quiz Game](https://dancornutt.github.io/UWB-04HW-Quiz/)

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have a good IDE for making edits to the code. For this project VS Code was used and was very useful.
Below are the tools used for this site:
    * IDE
    * Git
    * Github account
    * Browser (Chrome was used for development)

### Installing

These are the installation steps to get the site up and running:

    * Log into Github
    * Fork this repo
    * Clone your Forked repo on your local machine
    * Navigate to the index.html file and open it in your favorite browser
    * Select 'Start Game' to play!


## Running the tests

No tests were designed for this project. This is a future area of need and opportunity for collaboration.


## Built With

* [javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - The web css framework used
* [git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Used to store the code base
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - Used as the browser

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute! Reach out via github for collaboration. I am looking for contributers to connect the game library of questions, choices, and results to a database for more gameplay without seeing the same question.
